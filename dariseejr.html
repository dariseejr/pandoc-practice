<h1 id="what-tools-have-you-we-worked-with-so-far-in-this-class">What tools have you we worked with so far in this class?</h1>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>Terminals</li>
<li>Visual &amp; text-formatting languages</li>
<li>Jekyll</li>
<li>Pandoc ## Which have you found most potentially useful? I found using GitHub the most useful. ### Why? I think GitHub is a very useful application because it keeps track of changes over a large amount of data. Trying to keep track of those changes mentally would be very difficult, so I appreciate the functionality of GitHub. # What tools have been the most difficult to learn?</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Terminals</li>
<li>Visual &amp; text-formating languages</li>
<li>GitHub ## Why have they been particularly difficult to learn and use? I think the most difficult concept we've been over in the class has been using a terminal. Terminals all have different sort of commands and gets really confusing when you have to think of all the differing commands and their switches.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think out of all the visual languanges we've been using CSS has been the most difficult to understand. This mainly because of the different ways to implement colors and boxes on a website without using a UI for visual implementation.boxes</p>
<p>GitHub is difficult to master, but I understand the basic workflow. # What tools would you like to learn more about? I would like to learn more about what I can do with these visual &amp; tect-formating languages and also work more with GitHub. * * *</p>
<p><strong><em>When you are finished with the questions in file:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I want you to change the name of the file to your GitHub username.</li>
<li>You will then work as a group to convert the file to HTML, DOCX, and ODT formats, per the instructions in class.</li>
<li>Then I want you to add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
<li>Finally, you will create a pull request in GitHub to get these files back into my original repository.</li>
</ol>
